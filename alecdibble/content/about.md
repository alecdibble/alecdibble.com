My name is Alec Dibble. I am a web and software engineer. 

My specialty in growth engineering, a set of skills required to help web businesses thrive and grow. Growth engineering requires specialties such as front-end development expertise, marketing automation and business intelligence integration, and analytics implementations to calculate conversion rates and track ROI.

While getting my electrical engineering degree at UCSB, I did undergraduate research funded by the National Science Foundation. The research involved high speed control systems, which I presented as my senior project.
